## Installation Instructions

To install and run the Financial Literacy Game, ensure that you are on Mac or Windows and follow these steps:

**1. Install Maven:**  
    Ensure that you have Maven installed on your system. You can download Maven from
    [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), or you can run the following command in your terminal:

    mvn clean install


**2. Clone the repository from GitHub on any operating system:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   cd [repository-folder]
   ```

**3. Check Configuration:**   
To ensure that the game runs, you need to check that your settings are configured correctly.
- Check that you have Java installed on your system.
- Ensure that you are using Java version 11 or higher.
- Use SDK: "corretto-11" (Amazon Corretto 11.0.25 - aarch64).This can be selected by going to "File" ->
"Project Structure" -> "Project" and then seek for the "SDK" dropdown and 
select it. If you don't have it installed, you can select the download SDK option in SDK selector and get it from there.

**4. Retrieve and add all API Keys:**.  
To make the program run, you need to add all the API keys. To do this, create a config.properties file in the
repository folder and add the following API keys from these websites...  
  
     
- <u>Polygon API</u>:  
     To add the Polygon API key (Stock API), navigate to https://polygon.io/ and simply select 'Create API Key' on their
     home page and sign up/log in, and retrieve your API key there and add it to your config.properties file.  
  ```bash
  polygonApi.key=[YOUR_API_KEY]
  ```
- <u>Name API</u>:  
    To add the Name API key, navigate to https://nameapi.org/ and simply select 'Get API Key' in the top right corner
    of the website and input your email to make an account and receive your custom API key.
  ```bash
  nameapi.key=[YOUR_API_KEY]
  ```
- <u>MongoDB API</u>:  
    To add the MongoDB API key, navigate to https://www.mongodb.com/ and simply select 'Try Atlas for free' on their
    home page and sign up/log in. Now, in order to make a connection to the MongoDB database, you need to create a
    cluster and retrieve the connection string for it. If you do not have any clusters created, navigate to either
the "Create" button to create a new cluster or check your "All Clusters" section in case you have an unused free
cluster.

  in the image below. Make sure to change your dbpassword to the password for your database username.

  Once all is done. Take this API key and place it in your config.properties file and add the two lines below it as
well.

  ```bash
  mongo.uri=[YOUR_API_KEY]
  mongo.database=mydatabase  
  mongo.collection=users
  ```


**5. Run the game:**  
    Run the game by opening the Main.java file in the following directory: 

```bash
src/main/java/app/Main.java
```
