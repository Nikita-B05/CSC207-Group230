_Principles of Universal Design_

1. Equitable Use:
   Our program adheres to this principle by ensuring that core features, such as making decisions and tracking stats, are accessible regardless of a user's age, skill level, or experience. For example, the game provides simple, text-based feedback for errors and clear labels on all buttons. In the future, we could improve accessibility for users with visual impairments by adding screen reader support and audio cues. We could also expand on the ages we have in the game demonstration to be inclusive of all ages.

2. Flexibility in Use:
   The program supports flexibility by allowing users to make decisions at their own pace without any time constraints. Additionally, it can be played in light or dark mode, accommodating preferences for visual comfort. To further enhance flexibility, we could implement customizable font sizes and input methods, such as keyboard shortcuts or voice commands.

3. Simple and Intuitive Use:
   Our program provides an intuitive user interface with clear labels, organized layouts, and straightforward navigation. Button labels, like "Submit" and "Cancel," indicate their functions, and users receive visual confirmation when actions are completed. To improve, we could include a guided tutorial for new players to reduce the learning curve.

4. Perceptible Information:
   Key information, such as game stats and decision options, is displayed prominently and uses high-contrast text for better visibility. The program currently lacks audio feedback, which could be implemented to support users with vision impairments.

5. Tolerance for Error:
   Error messages are displayed when invalid actions are performed, such as selecting an unavailable option. However, the program could further adhere to this principle by providing an "undo" feature or warnings before irreversible actions like confirming a name change or a password change.

6. Low Physical Effort:
   Users can interact with the program using simple clicks or taps, minimizing physical strain. Since the game does not require rapid or repetitive actions, it accommodates users with limited physical dexterity. A future improvement might include voice command functionality for hands-free operation.

7. Size and Space for Approach and Use:
   The interface is designed with large buttons and a layout that avoids overcrowding, making it accessible to users on various screen sizes. To better adhere to this principle, we could implement responsive design features to optimize the layout for all sorts of display sizes.

_Target Market_

If we were to market our game, we would mostly target high school students who are interested in learning more about personal finance with a drive to learn more about the real world. 
Students interested in personal finance or life simulation games might find our program particularly appealing due to its inclusion of financial and happiness tracking mechanics.
Especially because the content of the game is geared to be educational, we wouldn't have success marketing to senior citizens or older adults who may already feel that they already understand personal finance.
By targeting students, we would be able to promise an gamification aspect to learning, who would most appreciate this experience.

_Demographic Usage_

Our program may be less likely to attract users who are not familiar with interactive games or those who already think they understand the basic principles of personal finance. 
Additionally, individuals with visual or motor impairments may face barriers due to the lack of screen reader support and alternative input methods. 
Users from non-English-speaking backgrounds might also be excluded unless language localization features are implemented. 
To address these gaps, we would need to prioritize accessibility features and broaden language support in future updates.
